Nothing special.  Created a local branch called "localTestBranch", committed the branch to Github, created this file locally, and will stage/commit to Github.

Confirm:
1. File is added to Github
2. File is ONLY visible on Github in the localTestBranch branch and NOT in the master.

Once confirmed:
3. Merge localTestBranch to master
4. Delete localTestBranch on Github
5. Refresh locally and confirm localTestBranch is deleted and we're once again editing in master.
